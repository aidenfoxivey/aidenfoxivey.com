# Day 14

Hey there! I’ve been really bad with keeping up with this blog. Today was a day mostly for figuring out what I want to do, trimming down my work, and learning Haskell! I spent a decent amount of time going over the strange idiosyncrasies of Haskell and trying to internalize them. Perhaps the most confusing one for me is this one:

```haskell
[x+y | x <- [1,2], y <- [1,2]]
``` 

This weirdly evaluates to [2,3,3,4] if I’m correct. I practiced German again today, which was nice, but I don’t really think I’ve figured out what I want to do with it long term.

Here’s a list of what I was up to:

* Read the Haskell introduction.

https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction

* Started going through “Learn You a Haskell For Great Good”

* “Learn Physics With Functional Programming” by Scott N. Walck

I’m pretty busy so don’t expect a blog post tomorrow. My apologies.
