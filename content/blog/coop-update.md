Long time no chat! Finals season is almost done for me. Just two more exams and
I'll be able to say I'm all done. I can't say I'm super fond of having to work
through finals all that much 

Unfortunately, the co-op opportunity that I talked about having in a prior post
has fallen through. I won't get into the specifics, but it was not a good fit
for either of us.

As a result, I applied for the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and got in! I'm beyond excited
about it and I've also lined up a local startup to work for during this time.
I'm very pleased to have avoided the issue of employment this term, as it seems
to be the trend to not have any good job.

In other news, I've got a blog post in the workings about the CHICKEN Scheme
Compiler. My plan so far for my time at the Recurse Center is to write a
compiler of my own, possibly using Scheme 5 (do people call it that?) as a
target. 

Also, I started [a chain on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aidenfoxivey/110243666746755004) asking Matt Godbolt
for books on compilers and interpreter design. It has some good picks out of it.
I'll summarize them below for posterity!

- *Moden Compiler Construction in ML* by Andrew W. Appel
- *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman
- *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom
- *Essentials of Compilation* (Python Edition) by Jeremy G. Siek
- *Engineering a Compiler* by Cooper and Torczon

Not technically a compiler book, but very cool:
- *Principles of Program Analysis* by Nielson, Nielson, and Hankin

Some academic resources listed too:
- Stanford's "CS143 Compilers" (by Alex Aiken) on Coursera
- Cornell's CS612
