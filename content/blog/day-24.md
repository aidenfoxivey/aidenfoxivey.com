I kind of just went ahead and decided this is day 24. To be perfectly clear,
I'm not actually sure it is day 24. I just made the arbitrary decision and
went ahead with it. From what I can tell, it's probably > 20 and < 30, so
I've guessed 24 as a decent intermediate.

Today I did more of the Busy Beaverâ€™s course on TigYog, which has talked a bit
about the Halting Function, Godelâ€™s 1st Incompleteness theorem, and a few
other ideas of computability. Interestingly, most of the course is taught in
Javascript, which makes it fairly unknown to me.

I also worked more on rust_light, which was fun. I was trying to figure out
the difference between `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`, which is apparently
a matter of strictness.

Also, I arranged some coffee chats for tomorrow and picked up a switch for
Cosine to use. 

Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to go into the office.
