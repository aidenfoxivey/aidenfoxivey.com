A few days ago I had a discussion about the ethics and reasons for why an undergraduate
student in engineering might choose to illegally (in Ontario) use the
title "Engineer", in the event that it was given to them by an employer
during on of their co-ops. 

The specific act that makes this illegal in Ontario is called the
[Professional Engineering Act][1], which created Professional Engineers
Ontario and gave it the power and legal ability to impose a fine on those
who misrepresent themselves as professional engineers.

The relevant section for this discussion is below:

At face value, the act prohibits using the title "engineer" in a way that leads
to the belief that the person using it is a professional engineer. 

To be certain we understand what a professional engineer is, let's have a look in
the definitions section of the act.

> “practice of professional engineering” means any act of planning, designing,
>  composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising that
>  requires the application of engineering principles and concerns the
>  safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public
>  welfare or the environment, or the managing of any such act; (“exercice de
>  la profession d’ingénieur”)

It's pretty clear to see that this applies pretty generally to most, if not all, 
roles that we traditionally call engineering. You can argue for software engineering 
and disciplines that don't directly deal with something that's obviously tangible
to be considered perhaps "not engineering", but I see it as having a pretty sizeable 
impact on humanity. 

I think the reason we classically consider civil engineering or environmental engineering
as being professional engineering comes down to the fact that the largest clients
for both are, in some structure, either the government itself, or companies under
very strong supervision by the government.

## Why are we so fussy about engineering being accredited?

The classic touchstone for this is the Quebec Bridge collapse, occuring in August
29th of 1907 and then September 11th of 1916. To my knowledge, and according to [this
article][4], it remains the most deadly (in terms of casualties) bridge collapse 
in Canadian history. The reason for the collapse comes down to the dead load applied 
on the structure. For those not in the know, the dead load refers to the latent weight
of a structure that it has and addition weights from things that will not change over 
time. The main dead load for this bridge was its own weight, but additional things like
decorations or lights also count as a dead load.

I'm not studying a very physical engineering subdiscipline, so admittedly I can't
offer too much comment about the specifics of collapse, but the liability issue 
comes down to the fact that calculations done by the initial engineering team weren't
checked during construction and were only valid for a smaller dead load.

The result of this was that a Royal Commission by the federal government that found 
that two engineers, Theodore Cooper and Peter L. Szlapka, were those guilty of 
the bridge failure. From what is understood, neither of them faced any penalties.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! include the precise words from the royal commission

We can conclude that it is important to actually have a licensing mechanism for 
engineers and ensure that we treat it as a generally licensed profession. Now, abstractly
we would really wish that *everyone* who works on dangerous things would be 
licensed, but that isn't the case. Understandably, it's not often terribly profitable
to have red tape when you are used to having none. For example, it would arguably 
be important for those working at large hedge funds, banks, and other financial 
organizations to take an oath to avoid causing harm as a result of their decisions.

We know this is not the case at all. Now, you can argue with me on this point, but 
the actions taken by those at !!!!! mention investment bankers that lead up to the 
2008 financial crash, were most certainly not ones that were directly aiming for a 
general wellbeing of people.

It's also clear that accredited people can and have been inept at their job
!!! include this

In a general case, we can agree that accreditation and making ethical oaths is a 
generally good thing for public wellbeing.

## On the importance of words

We use words every day to communicate different things and with varying
degrees. No one, including me, is ever going to really be able to agree on
what is an okay usage of it. For some people, using crass language is
considered acceptable, and for others it represents something fundamentally
wrong. 

Let's consider a brief example. For emphasis, we often will say ["I'm starving"][2]
to communicate that we are quite hungry. Usually this does not literally
imply that we are starving. Thus, we can conclude that words have different
levels of acceptability depending on context and company.

Let's make this a bit more specific to the problem. I'm sure those reading
this are already aware of some common exceptions that fly in spite of the PEO
upholding a promise to pursue legal action. Common examples include audio engineers
(sometimes known as producers), [combat engineers][3], and locomotive engineers.

None of these positions require you to be a Professional Engineer. Perhaps there are
some benefits for being a combat engineer in terms of CAF payscale, but it is 
not a requirement of the position to be formally a professional engineer.

## Enter the gauntlet





Despite it not being accurate, the PEO is going to have to go through hundreds
and hundreds of people who are employed in Canada in SWE and have no
engineering degree at all - not even working towards one. I could see this
being relevant in EE, but the average CE going for some less old fashioned
company probably would be foolish to strike engineer from their title for
fear of legal retaliation or representing themselves incorrectly. In my mind
the usage of engineering for many tech companies is basically
because “developer” sounds a bit lower stakes. Not that I necessarily
recommend and endorse using engineer in that way, but this isn’t EE power
engineering or CEE. For better or worse, the tech world is familiar with so
much grifting that this is incredibly minor and arguably unnecessary. There’s
virtually no legal oversight in SWE roles or big tech in general, unlike CEE
or EE. Physical infrastructure has a much bigger level of oversight than
software does.
