A week ago I had a discussion about the ethics and reasons for why an undergraduate
student in certain engineering programs might choose to illegally (in Ontario) use the
title "Engineer", in the event that it was given to them by an employer
during on of their co-ops.

The specific act that makes this illegal in Ontario is called the
[Professional Engineering Act][1], which created Professional Engineers
Ontario and gave it the power and legal ability to impose a fine on those
who misrepresent themselves as professional engineers.

The relevant section for this discussion is below:

At face value, the act prohibits using the title "engineer" in a way that leads
to the belief that the person using it is a professional engineer.

To be certain we understand what a professional engineer is, let's have a look in
the definitions section of the act.

> “practice of professional engineering” means any act of planning, designing,
> composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising that
> requires the application of engineering principles and concerns the

It's pretty clear to see that this applies pretty generally to most, if not all,
roles that we traditionally call engineering. You can argue for software engineering
and disciplines that don't directly deal with something that's obviously tangible
to be considered perhaps "not engineering", but I see it as having a pretty sizeable
impact on humanity.

I think the reason we classically consider civil engineering or environmental
engineering as being professional engineering comes down to the fact that the
largest clients for both are, in some structure, either the government
itself, or companies under very strong supervision by the government.

## Why are we so fussy about engineering being accredited?

The classic touchstone for this is the Quebec Bridge collapse, occuring in August
29th of 1907 and then September 11th of 1916. To my knowledge, and according to [this
article][4], it remains the most deadly (in terms of casualties) bridge collapse
in Canadian history. The reason for the collapse comes down to the dead load applied
on the structure. For those not in the know, the dead load refers to the latent weight
of a structure that it has and addition weights from things that will not change over
time. The main dead load for this bridge was its own weight, but additional things like
decorations or lights also count as a dead load.

I'm not studying a very physical engineering subdiscipline, so admittedly I can't
offer too much comment about the specifics of collapse, but the liability issue
comes down to the fact that calculations done by the initial engineering team weren't
checked during construction and were only valid for a smaller dead load.

The result of this was that a [Royal Commission by the federal government][5] that found
that two engineers, Theodore Cooper and Peter L. Szlapka, were those guilty of
the bridge failure. From what is understood, neither of them faced any penalties.

There is more on file, but this is really all the essentially information found inside
the conclusions to the Royal Commission. In essence, it marked a moment where the oversight
of engineers lacked

We can conclude that it is important to actually have a licensing mechanism for
engineers and ensure that we treat it as a generally licensed profession. Now, abstractly
we would really wish that *everyone* who works on dangerous things would be
licensed, but that isn't the case. Understandably, it's not often terribly profitable
to have red tape when you are used to having none. For example, it would arguably
be important for those working at large hedge funds, banks, and other financial
organizations to take an oath to avoid causing harm as a result of their decisions.

We know this is not the case at all. Now, you can argue with me on this point, but
the actions taken by those at [Lehman Brothers][6] that lead up to the
2008 financial crash, were most certainly not ones that were directly aiming for a
general wellbeing of people.

It's also clear that accredited people can and have been inept at their job. Medical
doctors go through an unpleasant amount of schooling and accreditation, all for some
of them to end up with malpractice charges.

In a general case, we can agree that accreditation and making ethical oaths is a
generally good thing for public wellbeing, but it isn't a silver bullet.

## On the importance of words

We use words every day to communicate different things and with varying
degrees. No one, including me, is ever going to really be able to agree on
what is an okay usage of it. For some people, using crass language is
considered acceptable, and for others it represents something fundamentally
wrong.

Let's consider a brief example. For emphasis, we often will say ["I'm starving"][2]
to communicate that we are quite hungry. Usually this does not literally
imply that we are starving. Thus, we can conclude that words have different
levels of acceptability depending on context and company.

Let's make this a bit more specific to the problem. I'm sure those reading
this are already aware of some common exceptions that fly in spite of the PEO
upholding a promise to pursue legal action. Common examples include audio engineers
(sometimes known as producers), [combat engineers][3], and locomotive engineers.

None of these positions require you to be a Professional Engineer. Perhaps there are
some benefits for being a combat engineer in terms of CAF payscale, but it is
not a requirement of the position to be formally a professional engineer.

## The core argument

I don't see it reasonable to try to argue that really any sort of engineering student
is incapable of doing immense hard. Even a software engineer is capable of immense
evil through rootkits, spyware, and malicious code. Frankly, SWE jobs probably do
cause the most damage to broader society, seeing as though they're implementing things
that are used by a massive group of people.

That said, it's worth understanding that tech generally doesn't have strong morals
and the requirement to actually follow ethical guidelines would likely not bode well
for actually being able to be emplyoyed in the software engineering field in general.
Tech already resists censorship and regulation in subtle ways, so creating a class
of people who are legally required to exercise professional judgement is fundamentally
a poor idea from perspective of employment.

Now, as for the actual situation, the number of people who graduated ECE in 2022 who are
certain that they will pursue a P.Eng post graduation [are roughly 5% of respondents][7].

It's not even particularly unreasonable given the job market widely having no interest
in software developers possessing a P.Eng. A simple search on LinkedIn, Indeed, or Google
proves that there are copius amounts of "Software Engineer" jobs that require no
engineering degree, much less an actual P.Eng.

The truth of the matter is that it's perhaps not accurate to describe the average developer.
Engineering is somewhat cheapened when used to describe the process of fumbling around
with React to design a website. Arguably there's some necessity in engineering being
a precise and mathematical practice that requires understanding what happens at many
different levels. Consider the civil engineer - they need to understand materials
chemistry to really be able to make some comment on the state of a structure. The average
"software engineer" is, in reality, not concerned with actual implementation as much as
having something that works. At risk of sounding like a delusional person, consider that
simple applications like Visual Studio Code, Slack, or Spotify are so abstracted from the
hardware that they run inside the Chromium browser but packaged as their own app.

In my mind, this is something that we cannot *reasonably* call engineering.

Now, with all this thought out of the way, let's get down to the real core of the
situation. Regardless of what *is technically true*, the tech industry will happily
gobble up delusional perspectives and proudly use them. Look at AR for example. Broadly speaking, AR is an extremely over-hyped part of technology. The idea of spending time and effort to build a system that views the world, does some computation, and then spits out and image on top of it is ridiculous!

Would it be fun to have an AR world? Sure! Is it at all useful to the point where Google
should have been willing to lose what some estimate was over 100 million dollars on? No!
If you're finding yourself believing that it was a good use of development given the time,
consider all the other common issues with your devices. Would longer batteries have been
a better idea? Perhaps reducing the environmental cost of computation?

Big tech doesn't care about reality. Big tech is in it to win it - and sometimes that takes
breaks in the truth to sound one way on the hopes that it will improve certain qualities.
I don't see this as fundamentally evil either! Google, Meta, and Apple are all motivated to
try to deliver regular profits and the chance of a moonshot.

So then, why should we opt to use something less fashionable like "programmer" or "software developer" when "software engineer" is an option? Companies are already willing
to flout the law without (to my knowledge), almost any intervention by PEO.

For those concerned that PEO is going to hunt you down, keep in mind that the majority of
"software engineers" in Canada aren't even *working* towards an engineering degree. Most of
them will have a degree that is ostensibly **not** engineering and yet they will label
themselves a software engineer on their resume.  There's a lot of cases for PEO to get
before they get around to you.

After all, if you're used to the tech grift so far, then why be concerned about a little
bit of beneficial diction?
