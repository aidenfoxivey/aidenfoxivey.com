My first day of RC is finally here! I'm very excited about it. I had a wonderful call with
the facilitators, some alums, some current recursers (from Spring 2), and the Summer 1 round
of recursers.

We talked about the framework with which we intend on working through this next 12 weeks.

I'm already seeing the blog posts pour in from other Recurser's first days and honestly I'm
not sure this will be very good in comparison. To round out the post a bit, I'll cover a summary of what I intend on
doing today and some of my fears about this experience.

I fear that:

- I won't be smart enough to use this properly
- I won't choose the right project to work on
- I won't be very employable after

I'm trying to get my small brain to realize that this is ultimately not terribly useful, since worrying
is what will prevent me from doing anything worth talking about at all.

What I've done/will do today:

- Do 5 problems from Sedra & Smith on MOSFET amplifiers
- Publish the daily blog post (cough cough cough)
- Investigate the ELF format
  - Set up Macpine
  - Make a repo with instructions to replicate my work
  - Push it to Github
  - Look into the reference for ELF files
- Figure out what libc or muslc really are
- Meet with Luca to work on Cosine Networks
- Set up RSS for this blog

That's all for now. I'll try to do that post about the Chicken Scheme Compiler
soon, since I assume that it's the most interesting of the bunch.
