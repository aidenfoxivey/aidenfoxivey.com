Luckily, it's about 2 hours earlier than when I wrote the last daily blog post. I think my sleep will appreciate it.

Today was pretty productive. I went to a few lectures on campus to see what's in store for next semester. I also 
worked through the first 3 lectures from ECE252. It seems to be an interesting process -- one which I think will
probably help for future co-ops and this current position at Cosine Networks.

Unfortunately, there was no time spent on mahampreter today or the data structures in Nim repository. I think at this 
point, for the sake of my brain, sleep is the more imperative thing to do.

No responses yet regarding my engineering-licensing blogpost, but honestly I think I'm a little "blogged out" to decide
to spent time finishing my memory 101 or Scheme compiler blog posts.

One thing I'm contemplating is whether I should spend time writing a Scheme compiler or whether another language is a better 
idea? I think that's something to ask Zulip. I just worry that it's not technically impressive to write a compiler for
Scheme given that it's a relatively minimal language.
