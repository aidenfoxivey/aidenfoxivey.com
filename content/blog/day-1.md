Hey there! It's day one of my summer programming extravaganza. I'm supposed to
blog it because "something, something learning in the open". We'll see
whether that actually works for me. Tomorrow I'll have to try the same
approach, but with more information that's actually interesting.

Today I spent time running OpenWRT in Qemu. I don't really know what OpenWRT
is other than Linux on commodity networking hardware. I'm contemplating right
now whether I want to work on messing with OpenWRT to learn it, reading the
Linux Programming Guide (I think Guide -- maybe it's a Manual?), or reading
more of a computer networking textbook.

I've got two professional development courses this term. Urgh. They're really
never any fun. This time I have the demigod of ECE himself, Douglas Wilhelm
Harder, teaching the course. I suppose he makes up for it. Maybe I'm supposed
to treat engineering professionalism with more fealty, but I can't really get
myself to.

I didn't work on the interpereter today, which was a bummer. The next main
focus for the interpreter is actually figuring out how the abstract syntax
tree is supposed to work.

Oh, one more thing, I have three new blog posts in the works. In order of
release, they are about engineering licensing, memory managment in C and C++,
and the Chicken Scheme Compiler. 

I may or may not have been silly and named my interpreter project after my
friend. ðŸ’€
