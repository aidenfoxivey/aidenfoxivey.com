I trimmed down my list for what I want to work on at RC a fair bit. I'm actually proud of how much I figured out I
don't actually want to do. The unfortunate thing is that I'm not sure the remaining amount is actually feasible.

Tomorrow I'm going to try to figure out what resources I want to go through to learn about compiler development.
