It's late so I'm going to keep it brief. Today I did some pairing with Teon from RC. We did Conway's game
of life and eventually made it look rather cool. Ideally we would have done graphics but we didn't get around
to that.

I'm realizing quickly that I'm biting off much more than I can chew, so I think I'll need to evaluate scope creep by the end of the week.

Another thing that could help is having special settings for my brain to distinguish when I'm in work, RC, or home mode.

I'm also thinking about leetcode, fast.ai, Andrew Ng, Crafting Interpreters, Nim data structures, reading "Attention is All You Need" (I did a quarter of that today)
and a few other things.

My mind is a bit chaotic right now and I want it to settle down. Thanks for listening to my crappy little rant.
