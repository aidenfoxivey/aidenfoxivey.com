I spent a fair bit of time today trying to figure out macOS GUIs. I’m a little
under the weather so I slept a bunch and then I had a nap. It wasn’t really RC
today due to the USA celebrating Memorial Day. 

I’ll be perfectly honest, I have no idea what Memorial Day is supposed to be
about. I would assume the armed forces? I could be wrong there.

I read a few interesting blog posts that I’m going to link below:

I think I’m going to try to do VegCamp too, which should be fun.
