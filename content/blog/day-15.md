I broke my plan of not writing a blog post today. 

Last night I had a long discussion on 
safe injection sites and harm reduction in general. It's interesting to meet people who 
are very opposed to it. To be honest though, and not as a criticism of them, I rarely do
find an opposition to harm reduction that isn't based off of the fact that it's uncomfortable
and instead argues from a numerical basis. 

To be clear, I'm to pressed for time here to actually argue anything, so I'm not intending on doing that,
but I do think that it's still a bit silly to base opinions off of emotions rather than just data.

I think this is partially why I dislike leftist appeals to emotion. I'm not particularly into them because 
it feels like a cop-out. I would consider myself generally left, but appeals to emotion ultimately are 
mostly useful for arguments to the in-group. Those agreeing with emotion are usually already those inside it.

Arguably there's a reason that disseminating some of the health benefits of veganism works better than 
showing the insides of slaughterhouses, no matter how unbearable that video may be.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), numerical and constructive evidence does broadly seem to be more effective
than the alternative.

In terms of code today, I wrote some more Rust for cryptopals. I somehow managed to do the first two today
after spending ages on the first one. I can't say I'm particularly pleased at the speed of completion.
