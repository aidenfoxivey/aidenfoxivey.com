Day two already! Blah blah blah, cliche blog beginning. Alright, all good?

Today I started reading the Nim book. I think there's only one Nim book so far?

I cleaned up my github a bunch and finally finished the post on engineering licensing.

I think tomorrow I'm going to clean off my desk and see if I can make sure that I'm
focused enough to not try to do everything at the same time!

We'll see whether my OpenWRT VM works properly tomorrow during our work session!

P.S. I wrote this at 1:52 am on the following day. I know I'm cheating a bit, but that
blogpost on engineering licensing was really bugging me. Sleep is something I need but somehow suck at achieving.
