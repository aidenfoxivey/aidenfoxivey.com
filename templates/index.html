            Welcome to my dusty corner of the internet. I have a selection
                of writings under "posts." Everything else should be fairly self
                explanatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            FYI, I'm not currently using Github for most of my projects. You should
                go on SourceHut to see the latest things. As well, the HuggingFace link is
                there for future use. I have nothing on there because I haven't really messed
                around with serious machine learning in my spare time yet. I'm still trying
                to Grok some of the fundamentals, so I think it would be naive at best to post
                those on the link.
        </p>

            Please note that if you're on Safari, the "resume" link above may not
                actually render the PDF in browser. In that case, hit Cmd+s to save
                the file to view it locally. I'm currently in the process of trying
                to resolve the issue.

            I am more than happy to chat. Please do not abuse this. The University
                of Waterloo spam filters are capable, but in general it would be more
                polite to not bother sending spam in the first place.
